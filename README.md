# 🚀 MERN Crash Course - Product Management App

A full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to demonstrate proficiency in modern web development. This project is a **Product Management App** that allows users to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** products—showcasing a responsive front-end, robust back-end API, and seamless database integration.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Product CRUD Operations**: Add, view, update, and delete products with a user-friendly interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, responsive UI.
- **RESTful API**: Secure and scalable API endpoints built with Express.js and Node.js.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Efficient data storage and retrieval using MongoDB with Mongoose ODM.
- **State Management**: Utilizes Redux Toolkit for predictable state management in the front-end.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation for robust data handling.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for a smooth user experience.
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure management of environment variables using `.env` files.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Local or MongoDB Atlas)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/mern-crash-course.git
   cd mern-crash-course
````

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory and add:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

5. **Run the Backend**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

   Backend server runs at: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

6. **Run the Frontend**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   Frontend runs at: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## 🌐 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint            | Description            |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/products`     | Fetch all products     |
| GET    | `/api/products/:id` | Fetch a product by ID  |
| POST   | `/api/products`     | Create a new product   |
| PUT    | `/api/products/:id` | Update a product by ID |
| DELETE | `/api/products/:id` | Delete a product by ID |

### 🔄 Example Request (POST)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/products \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"Sample Product","price":29.99,"description":"A sample product"}'
```
